# Project-StickyDJ-Bot
## Introduction
This project aims to create an application which allows streamers to let their viewers take control of the music.
The application will run on the streamer's machine and listen to various clients, eg Twitch, Discord and the likes.
One viewer will then be able to control the music on the stream by utilizing various chat commands. Music will be played
either from files located on the streamer's machine, from Youtube or from Spotify.

The project design thus far has been heavily influenced by "Keiffster's Program-Y Chatbot Engine".
So big shoutout to him!

## Current Stage Of The Project:
